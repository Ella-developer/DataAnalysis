# ✈️ Flight Delay Analysis

## 📌 Project Title: *Uncovering the Hidden Patterns of Flight Delays*

---

## 🧠 Summary
This project explores a rich dataset of domestic flights with the goal of identifying key factors contributing to flight delays.  
It involved a full pipeline of:
- Data understanding
- Cleaning & imputation
- Outlier removal
- Feature engineering
- Visual storytelling

---

## 🔍 Key Highlights
- Investigated distribution & correlation of delay times across thousands of flights  
- Handled missing values using **KNN Imputer**  
- Removed outliers using **Z-Score**  
- Normalized data with **StandardScaler**  
- Delivered insight-ready data, ideal for modeling

## 📊 Most Impactful Visualization

### **Departure Delay vs Departure Time (Faceted by Origin Airport)**

> **Insight:** Certain airports show delay peaks during specific hours, revealing bottlenecks or scheduling inefficiencies.  
> Perfect for visual storytelling in a portfolio or presentation.

## 🛠 Tools & Techniques

- **Python**: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib  
- **Preprocessing**: KNN Imputer, Z-Score outlier removal, StandardScaler  
- **Visualization**: histograms, heatmaps, KDEs, scatter plots, FacetGrid  
- **Data Size**: Tens of thousands of flight records

---

## 🎯 Outcome

A cleaned, transformed, and insight-rich dataset—now ready for machine learning applications:
- Regression to predict delay times  
- Classification to detect critically delayed flights  
- Clustering for travel pattern segmentation

## ✅ Why This Project Stands Out

> Combines clean code, smart visualizations, and clear business insights—showcasing real-world data science impact in **aviation** and **logistics** domains.
